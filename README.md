## Detailed Description

The project is part of a hackathon idea, and it focuses on automating the following tasks:

1. **Find Hospitals:** In Bangalore city, the automation script identifies hospitals that are open 24/7, have a rating above 3.5, and optionally have parking facilities. The names of these hospitals are extracted and displayed for the user.

**Suggested Site:** The hackathon suggests using "practo.com," but participants are free to choose any other legitimate website for data extraction and automation.

## Key Automation Scope

The project involves automation tasks that cover the following key aspects:

1. **Handling Alerts and Multiple Browser Windows:** The automation script is designed to handle alert messages that may appear during the web interactions. It can also manage different browser windows if required during the process.

2. **Navigation Control:** The script can navigate back to the home page or any other relevant sections as needed to perform the desired tasks.

3. **Data Extraction and Collection:** Multiple options and details are extracted from web pages, and the relevant information is collected and stored in appropriate data structures, such as lists or collections.

4. **Filling Forms:** The automation script is capable of filling in forms on web pages, which is particularly useful when providing input data or scheduling appointments.

5. **Capture Warning Messages:** The script can effectively capture warning messages displayed as alerts during interactions with the website.


## Note

**Drivers:** The submitted zip file does not include the necessary browser drivers (e.g., Chrome driver and Edge driver) due to size constraints. To run the automation script successfully, you need to install the required drivers separately and include them in the data-driven framework.

**Instructions:** Make sure to follow the instructions provided to set up the necessary environment for running the automation script and ensure the drivers are properly configured.
